## Copy2Note
Upon locating the `.exe` file within the `./Copy2Note/Debug` directory, launching the program initiates real-time clipboard monitoring. It meticulously captures and records the clipboard contents into a markdown file, cleverly titled `Copy2Note_yyyyMMddHHmm.md`, either in a predesignated folder or by selecting a specific file of your choice.

## python scripts
`Remberry_import csv to md_script.py`: [Remberry](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/rememberry-translate-and/dipiagiiohfljcicegpgffpbnjmgjcnf) is a chrome extension to help me collect unfamiliar vocabulary. However, its current `export` feature, which merely saves words into a CSV file, falls short of my expectations.
